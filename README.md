## MatOct.js

[MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) and [Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) are popular software environments for scientific computing and data analysis. They provide a wide range of tools and libraries for numerical computations, data visualization, and machine learning.

[MatOct.js](https://github.com/vahidgh/matoctjs) is a project aimed at providing a MATLAB/Octave-like environment implemented in JavaScript. This project leverages the capabilities of JavaScript to create a flexible and interactive environment for mathematical computations and data analysis.

### MathJsLab

[MathJsLab](https://github.com/vahidgh/mathjslab) is an [interpreter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)) with language syntax like [MATLAB&reg;](https://www.mathworks.com/)/[Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

MatOct.js combines the approaches taken by MatJsLab with a JavaScript-based and Python-based interpreter to make it possible to convert MATLAB/Octave code to JavaScript and Python code. This allows for the creation of a flexible and interactive environment for mathematical computations and data analysis with any of the three languages.
